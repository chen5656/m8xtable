# M8x Table — Database (Cloudflare D1)

Single shared D1 database for all users (multi-tenant by `owner_user_id`).

## Setup

```bash
# Create the D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create m8x-table-db

# Run migrations
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply m8x-table-db --local   # local dev
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply m8x-table-db --remote  # production
```

## Migrations

| Migration | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `0001_initial.sql` | Full schema: users, recipes, ingredients, steps, collections, shopping list, meal plan, translations, custom categories |

## Key design decisions

- **Single database** for all users (multi-tenant by `owner_user_id`).
- **Soft delete** for recipes (`is_deleted` + `deleted_at`); auto-purge after 30 days (future cleanup script).
- **Draft model**: drafts are stored on-device only and never written to D1 until the user taps Save.
- **JSON arrays** stored as TEXT for tags (parsed at application layer).
- **R2 keys** stored as TEXT references for all media files.
- **Clerk user IDs** used as primary keys in the `users` table.
