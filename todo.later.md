Now, finish my app, no stop until you finished all the features in Plan.md
Now start on implementation. No stop until you finished the whole app with every feature in the plan, and every feature need to work as expected. 

Add test based on the plan. 

m8xtable

I have the full plan for my app in Plan.md. 
I have a style sample images:
    list.png will be the home page
    calendar.png will be the calendar page
    recipe.png will be the recipe detail page
I have prompt examples folder, each will present a style of the cover photo.

### 3.6 Recycle bin

- Soft-deleted recipes; hidden from main UI.
- Show countdown ("X days remaining") per recipe.
- User can restore within 30 days.
- User can select and permanently delete early ("empty bin").
- Auto-purge after 30 days (cleanup script added later).


### 3.7 Custom recipe pages

- Per-recipe generated HTML pages.
- One "pinned" page shown first; user can swipe to see others; can delete any.
- Stored in D1 (HTML text) with association to recipe and pinned flag.


### 3.10 Books (Premium tier only)

- Bookshelf component: shows covers, titles, downloaded status (boolean).
- Red badge on bookshelf button for new undownloaded books.
- Book file naming: `{title}_{collection-name}_{date}_{time}`.
- User can delete a book.
- Book tab hidden for non-Premium users.




- **Onboarding**: Guided tour for first-time users (empty state + walkthrough).


- **Paywall sites**: Try JSON-LD first. If parsing fails, show clear error and offer paste-as-text fallback. No attempt to bypass paywalls.


| **From share-to-app** | User shares content to m8xtable via OS share sheet; if it is a recipe (URL or text), create new recipe |


### 6.7 Custom recipe page (HTML generation)

- **Purpose**: User views recipe in a custom HTML layout in-app (swipe between versions) and uses it for sharing.
- **Reference**: Approach inspired by [ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/chen5656/ui-ux-pro-max-skill).
- **Live data**: HTML uses placeholders filled with current recipe data — ingredient/step changes flow through without regenerating.
- **Constraints (epub-ready)**: No flex, no grid, no JS, no `position: fixed`, no complex animation. Prompt includes these constraints.
- **Style presets**: Glassmorphism, Claymorphism, Minimalism, Brutalism, Neumorphism, Bento Grid, Dark Mode, Frosted Glass, Neon, etc. User can choose or skip.
- **Custom prompt**: User adds instructions (e.g. "make title orange and bigger"); system merges with previous context and sends to Gemini.
- **Thinking indicator**: Show processing state during generation.
- **Scoping**:
  - Global default template for recipes without a custom page.
  - Per-recipe: multiple generated pages, one pinned (shown first); swipe to others; delete any.
- **Bulk generation**: Apply same prompt to all or selected recipes in a collection. Token deducted per recipe; stops if tokens run out.
- **Token**: Each generation consumes tokens toward user limit.

### 6.8 Sharing

- **Share link**: Public (anyone with link can view). Shows user name, badge, and small watermark. If recipe has a custom page, show that; otherwise default template. User sets link expiration.
- **Share as long image**: Render HTML to a tall mobile-friendly image; includes QR code at bottom, user name, profile picture, and watermark. User saves the image locally and shares it themselves.
- **Share via OS share sheet**: Use the native system share sheet (the iOS/Android built-in sharing UI that shows iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, etc. based on installed apps).
- **Share collections**: See section 3.4 visibility (private / specific people / public).
- **Fork sync**: When a public/shared collection's source recipe is updated, users who forked it can initiate a sync (with conflict resolution UI).


### 6.9 Book generation

- **Input**: User selects one or more collections; each collection becomes a chapter.
- **Chapter**: Collection name as chapter title; user can add a description per chapter.
- **Book title**: User-defined.
- **Cover**: User uploads OR uses AI to generate. We provide example covers; user can ask AI to generate something similar, or use a fully custom prompt.
- **Structure**: Optional articles before/after recipe chapters; optional custom introduction per recipe.
- **Fork info**: Default shows fork attribution; user can toggle it off per book.
- **Export**: EPUB with same layout constraints as recipe pages. Fonts embedded in EPUB.
- **TOC**: Auto-generated from collection names (chapters) and recipe titles.
- **Queue**: Export runs in a Worker queue; user notified via push notification + in-app red badge.
- **Bookshelf**: See section 3.10 for UI details.
- **Tier**: Only Premium ($39.99/mo) tier can create ebooks.
- **Downgrade**: See section 4 downgrade handling.


## 7. Recipe page generation (detail)

- **Flow**: User selects style + optional custom prompt. Backend sends recipe data + constraints + prompt to Gemini. Returns epub-safe HTML.
- **Live data**: HTML references recipe data via placeholders; edits to recipe reflect without regenerating.
- **Storage**: HTML stored in D1; recipe-to-page association and pinned flag in DB.
- **Display**: In-app WebView; pinned page shown first; swipe to browse others.



## 8. Book generation (detail)

- **Title**: User-defined.
- **Cover**: Upload or AI-generated (with example templates).
- **Chapters**: One per collection; user-defined chapter description.
- **Sections**: Optional intro/outro articles; optional per-recipe introduction.
- **Fork info**: Default shows fork attribution (source URL or user); user can toggle off.
- **Output**: Single EPUB file with epub-safe HTML per recipe, embedded fonts, auto-generated TOC.
- **Delivery**: After queue processing, download available in bookshelf. Red badge for new books. Push notification when export completes.
- **Naming**: `{title}_{collection-name}_{date}_{time}`.
- **Management**: User can delete books.

## 10. Fork system (like GitHub)

- **Fork from URL**: External recipe (e.g. NYT Cooking); records `forked_from_url`.
- **Fork from shared recipe**: Another user's public/shared recipe; records `forked_from_recipe_id`.
- **Source tracking**: Always record when and where the recipe was forked.
- **Sync from source**: When the source recipe is updated, the forked user can initiate a sync. On conflict (both sides changed), user resolves via conflict resolution UI.
- **Star & fork counts**: Each recipe shows how many stars and forks it has (like GitHub repos).
- **Paywall sites**: Device fetches page content; send to Gemini Worker for parsing. Try JSON-LD first; fail with clear error and paste-as-text fallback. No attempt to bypass paywalls.


## 13. Future considerations

Items explicitly deferred for future development:

- Semantic / natural language search (architecture documented in Search-Discussion.md).
- Screen reader accessibility (VoiceOver / TalkBack).
- Wine pairing hyperlinks with affiliate commission.
- Admin panel for ingredient vocabulary management.
- Recycle bin auto-purge cleanup script.
- Book file archive cleanup script on downgrade.
