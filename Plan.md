| **From photo (dish)** | User photographs a dish; AI identifies the dish give user three options to choose from. - then continue  the **AI generate** flow |
| **AI generate** | User enters recipe name; Gemini generates full recipe; AI review (section 3.2 vocabulary matching); user edits and saves |
| **From URL** | User pastes URL; device fetches page content and sends to Gemini Worker; try JSON-LD structured data first, then AI parse; AI review; user edits and saves. Records `forked_from_url`. User can configure default cooking site URLs for quick access |
| **From paste** | User pastes plain text or markdown; parsed into recipe fields; user edits and saves |

- **Cover & step images**: if photo scan, use the scan, if from url, use the image from url. user can replace the cover image and step images from camera/library OR generate via Gemini (one image at a time; credits cost).

## 9. Non-functional requirements

### 9.1 Design

- **Tone**: Sophisticated, exclusive; same design language across all screens.
- **Balance**: Aesthetics and functionality equally important.
- **Design System**: 
1)  8pt grid (spacing only allow 4/8/12/16/24/32/40/48)
2） 使用 design tokens (color/spacing/radius/shadow/typography),support light/dark
3）严格排版层级（32/24/20/16/14/12+ 对应行高），每个Card 信息不超过3行风格：克制、中性、留白足、轻边框、轻投影、微动效 （hover/focus）输出：结构说明 + token表+React/Tailwind 可运行代码

### 9.2 Implementation

- **Modularity**: Modular features, reusable components and functions.
- **Concurrency**: Avoid race conditions (e.g. save while generating).
- **Deploy**: Each major piece has a deploy doc (`.md`); any new service includes setup instructions.

### 9.3 Localizations (target locales)

`en`, `zh-Hans`.

### 9.4 Error handling

- On failure (tokens exhausted, R2 error, Clerk down, etc.): show clear error message.
- Provide support links: email contact@aclogics.com + help center https://answer.aclogics.com/ (placeholder domains).
- All errors logged to Sentry.

### 9.5 Accessibility

- Dynamic font scaling (respect system font size setting).
- Reduced motion (respect system "reduce motion" setting).
- Screen reader support deferred to a future pass.
