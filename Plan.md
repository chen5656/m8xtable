### 3.2 User

- **Profile**: Display name, avatar.

### 3.3 Collections

- User-created groups of recipes (e.g. "Weeknight", "Holiday").
- Max 999 collections per user.
- Recipe can belong to multiple collections.
- Operations: create, rename, pin, delete (user can choose: 1. recipes are unassigned, not deleted; 2. recipes are moved to recycle bin).
- Searchable by collection name and description.
- **Visibility**: Private (default), shared with specific people (login required), or public.
- Uses the same grid layout as the home gallery.

### 3.5 Favorites

- Boolean flag on recipe (`is_favorite`).
- Toggle gallery to show favorites only.

### 3.6 Recycle bin (skip for now — user can delete to recycle bin, but cannot view it)

### 3.8 Shopping list

- Each recipe page has an "Add to shopping list" button.
- **Tab 1 — Recipes**: List of added recipes; can remove one or all.

### 3.9 Meal plan calendar

- Lives in the bottom tab bar.
- Calendar view where user can add recipes or free-text notes to any date.

## 4. API key management

Each user stores their own API keys for AI providers in the app Settings. AI requests are made directly from the device to the provider — there is no server-side proxy or gateway for AI calls.

Supported providers:

| Provider | Used for |
|----------|----------|
| **Gemini** | Recipe generation,translation, image generation, URL parsing |
| **OpenAI** | Voice-to-text (gpt-4o-audio-preview) |
| **Claude** | Alternative recipe / text generation |
| **OpenRouter** | Multi-provider routing (optional) |
| **Qwen** | Alternative text generation |
| **GLM** | Alternative text generation |

- Keys are stored securely in the device keychain.
- User can add, update, or remove keys at any time.
- If no API key is configured for a required provider, the feature is disabled and the user is prompted to add one in Settings.

---

## 5. Device permissions

- **Camera + Photo library**: Cover image, step images, video capture/import.
- **Microphone**: Voice input for text fields.

Request only when the feature is first used; explain purpose in permission dialog.

---

## 6. Core features (by area)

### 6.1 Auth & profile

- **Login / sign-up**: Apple Sign In.
- **Delete account**: Full deletion with animated UI flow: deleting images, deleting recipes, deleting account. No data retained.
- **Terms & Privacy**: Shown on login screen.
  - No data kept after account deletion.
  - We do not share your recipes or generated data with anyone.
  - Data protected with Clerk and Cloudflare.
  - Contact: contact@aclogics.com; Help center: https://answer.aclogics.com/ (placeholder domains).

### 6.2 Recipe creation (multiple entry points)

**Draft model**: All new and in-progress recipes exist as device-local drafts until the user explicitly taps **Save**. On Save, the recipe is committed to the server. Drafts are stored on-device only and are **not synced between devices**.

The import menu lets the user select an entry method. Output language always matches the app language (language selection is not applicable for "From scratch" or "From paste").

| Method | Flow |
|--------|------|
| **From scratch** | Manual entry of all fields |
| **From photo (scan)** | User photographs a printed/handwritten recipe; AI extracts and fills in recipe fields |
| **From photo (dish)** | User photographs a dish; AI identifies the dish and gives three options; user selects one, then continues the **AI generate** flow |
| **AI generate** | User enters recipe name; AI generates full recipe; user reviews, edits, and saves |
| **From URL** | User pastes URL; device fetches page content and sends to AI provider; try JSON-LD structured data first, then AI parse; user edits and saves. Records `forked_from_url`. User can configure default cooking site URLs for quick access. **Paywall sites**: try JSON-LD first; if parsing fails, show clear error and offer paste-as-text fallback — no attempt to bypass paywalls. |
| **From paste** | User pastes plain text or markdown; parsed into recipe fields; user edits and saves |

- **Cover & step images**: if photo scan, use the scanned image; if from URL, use the image from the URL; if no cover image, AI-generate one using a default prompt style. No automatic step-image generation.
  User can replace cover image and step images from camera/library or generate via AI (one image at a time; requires a configured Gemini API key).

### 6.3 Recipe editing

- Full edit of all fields; `last_modified_at` updated on save.
- **Undo**: Session-level undo available while on the edit page (cached locally); lost once user leaves.
- Unsaved edits remain as a local draft on the current device until Save is tapped.

### 6.4 Recipe deletion

- Soft delete to recycle bin.

### 6.5 Voice & input UX

- **Voice input**: Available on any text input field. Uses OpenAI voice model (requires OpenAI API key in Settings); converts voice to text and fills the active field.
- **Keyboard**: Never overlaps focused input; "dismiss keyboard" button provided.

### 6.6 Discovery & organization

- **Home / gallery**: Grid layout inspired by iPhone Photos.
  - Each tile shows a configurable label (calories, name, servings, cook time, tags, etc.).
  - Eye icon toggle to show/hide labels globally.
- **Collections**: Same grid layout; see section 3.3 for full details.
- **Search**: Keyword search by recipe name and/or ingredients. Simple implementation for now.
- **Filters**: Tag, category, last-edited range, cook time range, servings range, difficulty, calorie range.
- **Favorites**: Toggle to show favorites only (see section 3.5).

### 6.10 Shopping list

See section 3.8 for full spec. Lives in the bottom tab bar.

### 6.11 Meal plan calendar

See section 3.9 for full spec. Lives in the bottom tab bar.

### 6.12 Settings & locale

- **Language**: App UI language follows device setting; user can tap the language option to open the system Settings app to change it.
- **API keys**: User enters and manages API keys for each supported AI provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, Qwen, GLM). Keys are stored in the device keychain. Each provider shows a status indicator (configured / not configured).
- **Account**: Manage profile, delete account.

## 9. Non-functional requirements

### 9.1 Design

- **Tone**: Sophisticated, exclusive; same design language across all screens.
- **Balance**: Aesthetics and functionality equally important.
- **Design System**:
  1. 8pt grid (spacing only: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48)
  2. Design tokens (color / spacing / radius / shadow / typography); support light/dark
  3. Strict typographic hierarchy (32 / 24 / 20 / 16 / 14 / 12 with matching line heights); each card shows no more than 3 lines. Style: restrained, neutral, generous whitespace, light borders, light shadows, subtle micro-animations (hover/focus)

### 9.2 Implementation

- **Modularity**: Modular features, reusable components and functions.
- **Concurrency**: Avoid race conditions (e.g. save while generating).
- **Deploy**: Each major piece has a deploy doc (`.md`); any new service includes setup instructions.

### 9.3 Localizations (target locales)

`en`, `zh-Hans`.

### 9.4 Error handling

- On failure (R2 error, Clerk down, AI provider error, missing API key, etc.): show a clear error message.
- Provide support links: email contact@aclogics.com + help center https://answer.aclogics.com/ (placeholder domains).
- All errors logged to Sentry.

### 9.5 Accessibility

- Dynamic font scaling (respect system font size setting).
- Reduced motion (respect system "reduce motion" setting).
- Screen reader support deferred to a future pass.
